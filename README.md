# Road to Web3. Week 1. Create and deploy an NFT

## Intro
This project is part of the Road to Web3 by the [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) team.

During week 1, you get an intro on NFTs, build one using [Openzeppelin´s wizard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard), deploy them on Rinkeby using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and uploading the metadata to [Filebase](https://filebase.com/)

To see the course you can either head over to [Alchemy´s Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veBu03A6ptw&list=PLMj8NvODurfEYLsuiClgikZBGDfhwdcXF) or see the [Blog version](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/road-to-web3/weekly-learning-challenges/1.-how-to-develop-an-nft-smart-contract-erc721-with-alchemy)

Deployment address (Rinkeby) = 0xf91c1bfb2dbacbfbd39a171ef0cd3e3b47893099
